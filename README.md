# PIMA_Diabetes_Prediction
This ML model to predict diabetes using the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, implemented in Google Colab, and leveraging a Random Forest classifier.

# Overview

The project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict diabetes using the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset. It leverages a Random Forest classifier to achieve robust predictions, with a focus on data preprocessing, model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and interpretability using SHAP values. The project is designed to run in Google Colab, making it accessible and reproducible for users with minimal setup.
